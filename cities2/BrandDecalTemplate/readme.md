# Introduction

This folder includes templates for all vanilla Cities: Skylinese II Brand Graphics currently in the game. These templates can be used to create decals, which can be placed over the vanilla graphics.

# Instructions

1. Copy the `.workshop\output` folder out of the `.workshop` folder, and rename it to your chosen company name.
2. Ensure you only include just the relevant brand objects to avoid increasing the mod size. To find out what items you need, plop the relevant building down in the Editor and see what ad items are present for that company.
3. The image sizes are already optimized to be as little as possible. When editing the images using Photoshop or GIMP, use the "Export" option instead of "Save As". Follow these guidelines: Set Metadata to none, Do not add Interlacing, don't save/embed Color Profile and other unnecessary data.

# Details

- There are 62 brand objects currently in the game, excluding the unique Muscle Car Garage signs. However, there are only 48 folders because some placeholders are the same size and can be reused.
- Each folder contains one image.png file. The name of the item indicates the object it represents.
- Some images have transparency. Ensure the transparent parts remain unchanged.
- Use the `.assets` folder to store the original images used for all items, which will be used later to add icons for the images.
- Note: The PNG images will be darkened later with a script. Ensure your submitted images are in true color and not manually color-adjusted..
